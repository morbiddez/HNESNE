Hear no evil speak no evil

Hear no Evil Speak no Evil is a collaborative survival horror game that fosters teamwork as it's main mechanic and broadens the concept of video games to an array of users including visually impaired individuals and other sense-impaired gamers. The target goal of the project is to make a fun atmospheric experience that everyone can enjoy together regardless sense impairment. 

The game utilizes 3d stereoscopic sound and is planned to feature force feedback in a way that is new and engaging to a broad audience. It can be played by anyone, with anyone; blind, deaf, or otherwise. 

The general gameplay is simple and familiar. Grid based movement, first person perspective, and of course a cliche homicidal maniac killer is after you. It's okay because he's slow, loud, and particularly stupid so it's up to you and all of your personalities to solve puzzles cause him trouble and move through the stage and into safety using audio, visual, and haptic feedback queues. The core mechanics strive to complicate the situation by seperating each sense into an individual player into their own "personality", making communication a key element to your survival.
